# DESIGN CHOICES
## General
- Added a progress bar for users to know what all steps are left and give them a sense of movement through the checkout experience.
Added transitions between pages to added smoothness to the transition process between each step
Added the logo and brand name to top left corner for brand recognition, and the basic colors of app throughout the web pages (got them through ui)
- Added a fun loader for users to not feel stuck during the loading process, especially when the traffic is high 
Checkout Page
- Added a shopping cart type list where the user can still manipulate there cart if required
- Added sections for phone and address if a user does not want to create an account but just wants to shop 
- The order summary card is a stuck to the webpage so the user can directly jump to payment after checking their whole shopping list and doesnt need to jump to the top 
- Added animations to buttons and the list for a dynamic user experience and a fun layout

## Confirmation Page
In this page I could add as much pazzaz as I wanted
- Added an image roller showing the products from order summary using three.js. Would make it scrollable in future
- Added animations to the status of the order to make tham pop out
- Added animations to buttons and the list for a dynamic user experience and a fun layout


## CHALLENGES
- Learning zustand: I have used redux and basic react useState hooks till date, so learning zustand for the project was a challenge. I had to learn how to create and change states, but it was a growing experience.
- Researching modern ui/ux principles: I researched about how users interact with the checkout pages, and what can make them leave and what elements should be there. It made me learn about the research that goes before actually starting coding and implementing the project
- Learning payment validation:  I have never added actual payment methods and validation for the same in any of my projects, so I had to learn how to do it from scratch and what all elements to include
- Balancing between a smooth and over the top and unnecessary ui experience: Sometimes in order to make a page unique and stand out we forget that the product at last is made for users to interact with it in a way that it facilitates their actions rather than getting them caught up in the design. Thus, it was a tightrope to walk on to decide how much of ui complexities I want to add to the pages to show my proficiency and what is just too much.
